<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

**To Do - App** is a small app where you can record all your tasks and projects you have to do. You can organize your week, and mark important and completed tasks.

## Requierements

1. Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos.
2. You should separate your application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules.
3. View all projects
4. View all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate… perhaps changing color for different priorities)
5. Expand a single todo to see/edit its details
6. Delete a todo
